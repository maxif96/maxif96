- ðŸ¤– About me: I am a curious and restless person, who always seeks to learn and be good at what I do. I think I'm like a sponge, absorbing and learning from everywhere.
- ðŸ–¥ My main languaje is Java, for now.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on adding some functionalities in the Api REST NGO-Proyect. I'm adding Spring AOP and cleaning the code. If you want to see what I can do you has to check it out. My next step then, will be to finish my Disney-proyect.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about DDD (Drive Domain Design) and I am also looking to learn microservices.
- âš¡ My best quality: Flexibilty, no doubt. I did many things throughout my life, and I was always able to adapt.
- ðŸ¤“ Random thought: I think about how important balance is: Be on the computer all day is not healthy. That's why I regularly do physical activity, I also do a little walk every day after lunch, and I read literature too. I think that disconnect is very important. Curiosly, I feel that those things make me smarter, a better developer, and a better problem solver ðŸ’ª.

- I am in actively looking for a job, so, if you don't hurry this talent might not be available.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can send me an email and I will answer you as soon as possible: maxifop96@gmail.com
